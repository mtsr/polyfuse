<p>This library provides the <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html"><code>ArcSwapAny</code></a> type (which you probably don't want to use
directly) and several type aliases that set it up for common use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="type.ArcSwap.html"><code>ArcSwap</code></a>, which operates on <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a>.</li>
<li><a href="../arc_swap/type.ArcSwapOption.html" title="ArcSwapOption"><code>ArcSwapOption</code></a>, which operates on <code>Option&lt;Arc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>.</li>
<li><a href="type.IndependentArcSwap.html"><code>IndependentArcSwap</code></a>, which uses slightly different trade-off decisions
‒ see below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that as these are <em>type aliases</em>, the useful methods are defined on
<a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html"><code>ArcSwapAny</code></a> directly and you want to look at its documentation, not on the
aliases.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock&lt;Arc&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code></a>, but it is faster, the readers are never blocked
(not even by writes) and it is more configurable.</p>
<p>Or, you can look at it this way. There's <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> ‒ it knows when it stops being used and
therefore can clean up memory. But once there's a <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc&lt;T&gt;</code></a> somewhere, shared between
threads, it has to keep pointing to the same thing. On the other hand, there's
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a> which can be changed even when shared between
threads, but it doesn't know when the data pointed to is no longer in use so it
doesn't clean up. This is a hybrid between the two.</p>
<h1 id="motivation" class="section-header"><a href="#motivation">Motivation</a></h1>
<p>First, the C++ <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr"><code>shared_ptr</code></a> can act this way. The fact that it's only the surface
API and all the implementations I could find hide a mutex inside wasn't known to me when I
started working on this. So I decided Rust needs to keep up there.</p>
<p>Second, I like hard problems and this seems like an apt supply of them.</p>
<p>And third, I actually have few use cases for something like this.</p>
<h1 id="performance-characteristics" class="section-header"><a href="#performance-characteristics">Performance characteristics</a></h1>
<p>It is optimised for read-heavy situations with only occasional writes. Few examples might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global configuration data structure, which is updated once in a blue moon when an operator
manually does some changes, but looked into through the whole program all the time. Looking
into it should be cheap and multiple threads should be able to look into it at the same time.</li>
<li>Some in-memory database or maybe routing tables, where lookup latency matters. Updating the
routing tables isn't an excuse to stop processing packets even for a short while.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lock-free-readers" class="section-header"><a href="#lock-free-readers">Lock-free readers</a></h2>
<p>All the read operations are always <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Lock-freedom">lock-free</a>. Most of the time, they are actually
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Wait-freedom">wait-free</a>. The only one that is <em>only</em> lock-free is the first <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a> access in each
thread (across all the pointers).</p>
<p>So, when the documentation talks about <em>contention</em>, it talks about multiple CPU cores having to
sort out who changes the bytes in a cache line first and who is next. This slows things down,
but it still rolls forward and stop for no one, not like with the mutex-style contention when
one holds the lock and other threads get parked.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are cases where readers block writers from completion. It's much more
limited in scope than with <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a> or <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock</code></a> and steady stream of readers
will <em>not</em> prevent an update from happening indefinitely (only a reader stuck in a critical
section could, and when used according to recommendations, the critical sections contain no
loops and are only several instructions short).</p>
<h2 id="speeds" class="section-header"><a href="#speeds">Speeds</a></h2>
<p>The base line speed of read operations is similar to using an <em>uncontended</em> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a>.
However, <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a> suffers no contention from any other read operations and only slight
ones during updates. The <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load_full"><code>load_full</code></a> operation is additionally contended only on
the reference count of the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a> inside ‒ so, in general, while <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a> rapidly
loses its performance when being in active use by multiple threads at once and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock</code></a> is slow to start with, <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html"><code>ArcSwapAny</code></a> mostly keeps its
performance even when read by many threads in parallel.</p>
<p>Write operations are considered expensive. A write operation is more expensive than access to
an <em>uncontended</em> <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html"><code>Mutex</code></a> and on some architectures even slower than uncontended
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html"><code>RwLock</code></a>. However, it is faster than either under contention.</p>
<p>There are some (very unscientific) <a href="https://github.com/vorner/arc-swap/tree/master/benchmarks">benchmarks</a> within the source code of the library.</p>
<p>The exact numbers are highly dependant on the machine used (both absolute numbers and relative
between different data structures). Not only architectures have a huge impact (eg. x86 vs ARM),
but even AMD vs. Intel or two different Intel processors. Therefore, if what matters is more
the speed than the wait-free guarantees, you're advised to do your own measurements.</p>
<p>However, the intended selling point of the library is consistency in the performance, not
outperforming other locking primitives in average. If you do worry about the raw performance,
you can have a look at <a href="../arc_swap/cache/struct.Cache.html" title="Cache"><code>Cache</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="choosing-the-right-reading-operation" class="section-header"><a href="#choosing-the-right-reading-operation">Choosing the right reading operation</a></h2>
<p>There are several load operations available. While the general go-to one should be
<a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a>, there may be situations in which the others are a better match.</p>
<p>The <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a> usually only borrows the instance from the shared <a href="../arc_swap/struct.ArcSwapAny.html" title="`ArcSwapAny`"><code>ArcSwapAny</code></a>. This makes
it faster, because different threads don't contend on the reference count. There are two
situations when this borrow isn't possible. If the content of <code>ArcSwapAny</code> gets changed, all
existing <a href="../arc_swap/struct.Guard.html" title="Guard"><code>Guard</code></a>s are promoted to contain an owned instance.</p>
<p>The other situation derives from internal implementation. The number of borrows each thread can
have at each time (across all <a href="../arc_swap/struct.Guard.html" title="Guard"><code>Guard</code></a>s) is limited. If this limit is exceeded, an
onwed instance is created instead.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you intend to hold onto the loaded value for extended time span, you may prefer
<a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load_full"><code>load_full</code></a>. It loads the pointer instance (<code>Arc</code>) without borrowing, which is
slower (because of the possible contention on the reference count), but doesn't consume one of
the borrow slots, which will make it more likely for following <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a>s to have a slot
available. Similarly, if some API needs an owned <code>Arc</code>, <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load_full"><code>load_full</code></a> is more
convenient.</p>
<p>There's also <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.peek_signal_safe"><code>load_signal_safe</code></a>. This is the only method guaranteed to be
safely usable inside a unix signal handler. It has no advantages outside of them, so it makes
it kind of niche one.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is possible to use a <a href="../arc_swap/cache/struct.Cache.html" title="Cache"><code>Cache</code></a> to get further speed improvement at the
cost of less comfortable API and possibly keeping the older values alive for longer than
necessary.</p>
<h1 id="atomic-orderings" class="section-header"><a href="#atomic-orderings">Atomic orderings</a></h1>
<p>It is guaranteed each operation performs at least one <code>SeqCst</code> atomic read-write operation,
therefore even operations on different instances have a defined global order of operations.</p>
<h1 id="customization" class="section-header"><a href="#customization">Customization</a></h1>
<p>While the default <a href="type.ArcSwap.html"><code>ArcSwap</code></a> and <a href="struct.ArcSwapAny.html#method.load"><code>load</code></a> is probably good enough for most of
the needs, the library allows a wide range of customizations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows storing nullable (<code>Option&lt;Arc&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>) and non-nullable pointers.</li>
<li>It is possible to store other reference counted pointers (eg. if you want to use it with a
hypothetical <code>Arc</code> that doesn't have weak counts), by implementing the <a href="trait.RefCnt.hmtl"><code>RefCnt</code></a>
trait.</li>
<li>It allows choosing internal fallback locking strategy by the <a href="gen_lock/trait.LockStorage.html"><code>LockStorage</code></a>
trait.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="alternatives" class="section-header"><a href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h1>
<p>There are other means to get similar functionality you might want to consider:</p>
<h2 id="mutexarc_-and-rwlockarc_" class="section-header"><a href="#mutexarc_-and-rwlockarc_"><code>Mutex&lt;Arc&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code> and <code>RwLock&lt;Arc&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code></a></h2>
<p>They have significantly worse performance in the contented scenario but are comparable in
uncontended cases. They are directly in the standard library, which means better testing and
less dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="the-same-but-with-parking_lot" class="section-header"><a href="#the-same-but-with-parking_lot">The same, but with <a href="https://docs.rs/parking_lot">parking_lot</a></a></h2>
<p>Parking lot contains alternative implementations of <code>Mutex</code> and <code>RwLock</code> that are faster than
the standard library primitives. They still suffer from contention.</p>
<h2 id="crossbeamatomicarccell" class="section-header"><a href="#crossbeamatomicarccell"><a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam/0.5.0/crossbeam/atomic/struct.ArcCell.html"><code>crossbeam::atomic::ArcCell</code></a></a></h2>
<p>This internally contains a spin-lock equivalent and is very close to the characteristics of
<code>parking_lot::Mutex&lt;Arc&lt;_&gt;&gt;</code>. This is unofficially deprecated. See the
<a href="https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/issues/160">relevant issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="crossbeam-arccell" class="section-header"><a href="#crossbeam-arccell"><a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam-arccell/"><code>crossbeam-arccell</code></a></a></h2>
<p>It is mentioned here because of the name. Despite of the name, this does something very
different (which <em>might</em> possibly solve similar problems). It's API is not centric to <code>Arc</code> or
any kind of pointer, but rather it has snapshots of its internal value that can be exchanged
very fast.</p>
<h2 id="atomicarc" class="section-header"><a href="#atomicarc"><a href="https://github.com/stjepang/atomic/blob/master/src/atomic_arc.rs#L20"><code>AtomicArc</code></a></a></h2>
<p>This one is probably the closest thing to <a href="type.ArcSwap.html"><code>ArcSwap</code></a> on the API level. Both read and
write operations are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Lock-freedom">lock-free</a>, but neither is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-blocking_algorithm#Wait-freedom">wait-free</a>, and the performance of reads and
writes are more balanced ‒ while <a href="type.ArcSwap.html"><code>ArcSwap</code></a> is optimized for reading, <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/atomic/blob/master/src/atomic_arc.rs#L20"><code>AtomicArc</code></a>
is „balanced“.</p>
<p>The biggest current downside is, it is in a prototype stage and not released yet.</p>
<h1 id="features" class="section-header"><a href="#features">Features</a></h1>
<p>The <code>unstable-weak</code> feature adds the ability to use arc-swap with the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Arc.html">Weak</a> pointer too,
through the <a href="type.ArcSwapWeak.html">ArcSwapWeak</a> type. This requires the nightly Rust compiler. Also, the interface
and support <strong>is not</strong> part of API stability guarantees and may be arbitrarily changed or
removed in future releases (it is mostly waiting for the <code>weak_into_raw</code> nightly feature to
stabilize before stabilizing it in this crate).</p>
